### 1. **Strategize Your Rolls**
Having extra dice can give you more opportunities to land on high-value properties or land on spaces that grant rewards. However, itâ€™s important to roll wisely. Plan your rolls strategically to land on the spaces that benefit you mostâ€”whether youâ€™re aiming to complete sets of properties or unlock bonuses.

### 2. **Unlock New Features**
Monopoly Go is always evolving, with new features, characters, and bonuses added regularly. Make sure youâ€™re using your free dice to explore these features. You can unlock new characters, abilities, and game modes by progressing through the game, and having extra dice will help you advance more quickly.

### 3. **Focus on High-Value Properties**
Once you have plenty of dice, focus on acquiring high-value properties. These are the spaces that offer the best return on investment when you build houses or hotels. With your 40,000 free dice, you can afford more rolls, giving you a greater chance to land on premium properties.

### 4. **Compete in Limited-Time Events**
Monopoly Go often hosts special limited-time events, and having extra dice will allow you to participate in these exclusive challenges. These events often offer great rewards, such as rare properties or in-game currency. The more dice you have, the more chances you have to win big during these events.

### 5. **Use Dice to Outsmart Your Opponents**
Monopoly Go is a multiplayer game, and with 40,000 free dice, you can take your game to the next level. Use your dice to outsmart your opponents by landing on spaces that force them into tough situationsâ€”like sending them to jail or making them lose valuable assets.

### 6. **Balance Your Risk**
With more dice at your disposal, itâ€™s easy to get carried away. However, be mindful of the risks. Monopoly Go is a game of chance and strategy. Make sure youâ€™re not overspending your dice or taking unnecessary risks that could cost you in the long run.
